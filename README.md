NovaGrid is not another DePIN network — it's a privacy middleware layer that plugs into existing ones. Hardware node operators prove compliance with zero-knowledge proofs, earn rewards stored as FHE ciphertexts, and relay telemetry through decentralised storage. No location, identity, or balance ever exposed.

---

## The Problem

Every DePIN protocol today has the same privacy gap:

| What it needs to verify | What it actually exposes |
|---|---|
| Node is in an approved region | Public GPS coordinates |
| Node meets performance thresholds | Public uptime / hashrate metrics |
| Reward was distributed correctly | Public balance visible to everyone |

Competitors can map your entire node fleet. Anyone watching the chain knows your earnings. This is a solved problem in cryptography — DePIN just hasn't applied it yet.

## The Solution

NovaGrid provides three composable privacy layers any DePIN protocol can integrate:

| Layer | Technology | What it hides |
|---|---|---|
| ZK Compliance | Aleo (Leo programs) | GPS coordinates, performance metrics |
| FHE Rewards | Fhenix + CoFHE | Reward balances, claim amounts, node rankings |
| DA Storage | 0G | Centralised relay server dependency |

The layers connect: the ZK proof produces a public **trust score** (0–100) which weights encrypted reward distribution on Fhenix — high-performing nodes earn more, while individual amounts stay private.

## Architecture

```
[Operator's Browser]
  ├── GPS + metrics  ──►  Aleo ZK Worker (WASM, runs in browser)
  │                         ├── verify_compliance         (location proof)
  │                         ├── verify_device_credentials (performance proof)
  │                         └── compute_node_score  ──►   trust_score (public u64)
  │
  └── Wallet + Permit ──►  Fhenix FHE Contracts (Ethereum Sepolia)
                             ├── NovaVault           (euint32 encrypted balances)
                             ├── RewardDistributor   (trust_score weighted deposits)
                             ├── PrivacyLeaderboard  (FHE.lt encrypted ranking)
                             └── SealedBidAuction    (FHE.gt max bid, FHE.eq win check)

[Hardware Node]
  └── Telemetry ──► Hardware Relayer ──► 0G DA Storage
```

**Privacy boundary:** Everything private stays in the browser. The only thing that ever hits a public chain is the trust score and the FHE ciphertext — both opaque to observers.

## Contracts

### ZK Compliance — `contracts/aleo-compliance/`

Leo program `compliance.aleo` deployed on Aleo Testnet:

| Transition | Private Inputs | Public Inputs | Output |
|---|---|---|---|

### FHE Settlement — `contracts/fhenix-settlement/`

Solidity contracts on Ethereum Sepolia using `@cofhe/sdk`:

| `SealedBidAuction` | `0xFc6d429BF9f505281E86FeE965dE94704DAF22F8` | Sealed-bid slot auction — `FHE.gt` finds max, `FHE.eq` checks winner |

**FHE operations used across contracts:**

| Operation | Where |
|---|---|
| `FHE.add` | Accumulate encrypted rewards + rank counter |
| `FHE.sub` | Encrypted claim subtraction |
| `FHE.mul` | Trust-score weighted reward calculation |
| `FHE.gte` | Underflow guard (balance ≥ claim amount) |
| `FHE.lt` | Per-node encrypted comparison for ranking |
| `FHE.select` | Encrypted conditional (if/else on `ebool`) |
| `FHE.gt` | Find encrypted maximum bid across all bidders |
| `FHE.eq` | Per-bidder encrypted win status check |

## Web Dashboard — `apps/web-dashboard/`

Next.js 15 (App Router):

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page — value proposition and how it works |
| `/dashboard` | Privacy layers status panel + module navigation |
| `/compliance` | ZK proof generation (Aleo WASM, runs in browser) |
| `/rewards` | FHE balance, claim, weighted deposit, private leaderboard |
| `/auction` | Sealed-bid slot auction — encrypted bids, FHE max selection, private win status |

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # starts web dashboard + hardware relayer
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Leo Contract Tests

```bash
cd contracts/aleo-compliance
leo run verify_compliance --input inputs/verify_compliance.in
leo run verify_device_credentials --input inputs/verify_device_credentials.in

## Demo Walkthrough

5-minute demo for hackathon judges. Goal: show that private inputs never leave the browser.

**Step 1 — ZK Compliance (Aleo)**
1. Open `/compliance`, connect Shield Wallet
2. Enter GPS coordinates and performance metrics → click **Generate ZK Proof**
3. Proof runs in WASM inside the browser — trust score appears (e.g. 92/100)
4. *Key point:* GPS and metrics are private inputs. Only the trust score is public output.

**Step 2 — FHE Rewards (Fhenix)**
1. Open `/rewards`, connect MetaMask on Ethereum Sepolia
2. Click **Weighted Deposit** — reward = base × trust_score, stored as `euint32` ciphertext
3. Balance shows as `[encrypted]` on-chain — click **Sign Permit** to decrypt your own value
4. *Key point:* Even the smart contract cannot read the balance. Only the permit holder can decrypt.

**Step 3 — Private Leaderboard**
1. Still on `/rewards`, scroll to **Private Node Leaderboard**
2. Click **Submit Encrypted Score** — trust score is encrypted client-side before submission
3. Click **Compute My Rank** — `FHE.lt` compares your score against every other node inside the FHE co-processor
4. Decrypt your rank with a permit — see how many nodes score below you
5. *Key point:* Nobody sees anyone else's score. The comparison happens entirely in ciphertext.

**Step 4 — Sealed Bid Auction**
1. Open `/auction`, connect MetaMask on Ethereum Sepolia
2. Enter a bid amount → click **Bid** — the amount is encrypted before submission
3. Owner clicks **End Auction Early** then **Finalize Auction** — `FHE.gt` loop finds the encrypted maximum across all bids without decrypting any
4. Click **Check Win Status** — `FHE.eq` compares your encrypted bid against the encrypted max
5. Sign a permit to decrypt — see **Winner** or **Not selected** — losing amounts are never revealed
6. *Key point:* No individual bid is ever decrypted. Winner selection happens entirely in ciphertext.
